    APPLICATION : RPNCalc Project Overview
========================================================================

Yet another code test practice thing. With thanks to SPT.

"Okay, then, make a RPN calculator. From standard input, read tokens which are either numbers or operators {*, /, +, -}. Don't bother with error checking."

I'mma call that three or four hours, I think.
